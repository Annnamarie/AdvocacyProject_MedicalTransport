        <h3>Social Impact</h3>
        <p>Limited access to healthcare transportation can lead to social isolation, especially for those unable to attend medical appointments. This isolation can cause feelings of loneliness and depression, affecting mental well-being. It can also strain relationships, as individuals may need more support due to unmet healthcare needs. Improving transportation can help people stay connected and engaged in their communities.

        <h3>Economic Impact</h3>
        <p>Not having reliable transportation to healthcare can result in higher healthcare costs due to delayed treatment and complications. It can also lead to lost wages and reduced economic productivity for those unable to work because of health issues. This situation can worsen financial problems and contribute to ongoing poverty cycles. Addressing transportation challenges is crucial for maintaining economic stability and reducing financial strain on individuals and communities.

        <h3>Healthcare Disparities</h3>
        <p>Limited access to healthcare transportation disproportionately affects low-income and marginalized communities, worsening existing healthcare disparities. This lack of access can prevent people from receiving preventive care and health education, further deepening these disparities. Improving transportation options is essential for ensuring that everyone, regardless of their income or background, can access healthcare services and work towards health equity.
